## 🚀 Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasantkbs/zettel-graph.git
cd zettel-graph

2. Set Up Your Notes
Place your Zettelkasten-style markdown notes in the notes/ directory. Ensure that links between notes are properly formatted to reflect their connections.

3. Generate the Graph Data
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required Python package:

pip install networkx

Run the script to generate the graph data:

python script/build_graph.py

This will create a graph.json file inside the data/ directory.

4. View the Graph Visualization
Open index.html in your preferred web browser to explore the interactive graph of your notes.



🧠 Emacs Integration
1. Load the Emacs Script
Add the following to your Emacs configuration to load the zettel-graph.el script:

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/zettel-graph/")
(require 'zettel-graph)

Replace "~/path/to/zettel-graph/" with the actual path to your cloned repository.

2. Usage within Emacs
After loading the script:

Use the provided functions to interact with your Zettelkasten notes.

Customize keybindings and functions as needed to fit your workflow.

🛠️ Dependencies
Python 3: For running the build_graph.py script.

networkx: Python package for creating and manipulating complex networks.

Emacs: For note-taking and integration with the visualization tool.

D3.js: Included via CDN in index.html for rendering the graph.
